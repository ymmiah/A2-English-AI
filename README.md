## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is a single-page application that runs entirely in the browser with no build step required.

**Prerequisites:**
*   A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (Google Chrome is recommended).
*   A simple local web server to serve the `index.html` file.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone or Download the Code:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-folder]
    ```

2.  **Configure Your API Key:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. Please follow the detailed instructions in the [API Key Configuration](#-api-key-configuration) section below.

3.  **Run a Local Server:**
    Serve the project's root directory using any static file server.
    
    **Example using Python:**
    ```bash
    # If you have Python 3 installed
    python -m http.server
    ```
    
    **Example using Node.js (`serve` package):**
    ```bash
    # Install serve globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g serve
    # Run the server
    serve
    ```
4.  **Open in Browser:**
    Navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## üîë API Key Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** This application will not work without a Google Gemini API key.

*   **Get Your Key:** Visit [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your free API key.

You can provide your key in two ways:

### Method 1: Via the Application UI (Recommended)

This is the easiest method. The key is stored securely in your browser's local storage.

1.  Launch the application and select the **A2 Test Prep** module.
2.  Navigate to the **My Profile** page from the sidebar or bottom navigation.
3.  Scroll down to the **AI Model Configuration** section.
4.  Paste your API key into the input field and click **Save & Reload**.

### Method 2: Local Development File (For Developers)

This method is useful for local development but will be **overridden** by any key set via the UI.

1.  **Create `config.js`:** In the project's root directory (same folder as `index.html`), create a new file named `config.js`.
2.  **Add Your Key:** Paste the following code into `config.js`, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key:
    ```javascript
    window.process = {
      env: {
        API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
      }
    };
    ```
3.  **Import in `index.html`:** Add the following line in `index.html` inside the `<head>` tag, **before** the main script (`/index.tsx`):
    ```html
    <script src="/config.js"></script>
    ```

> **Security Note:** Do **not** commit `config.js` to version control. If you are using Git, add `config.js` to your `.gitignore` file.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

Deploy this application on any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

When deploying, set an **Environment Variable** in your hosting provider's project settings:
*   **Name:** `API_KEY`
*   **Value:** `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY`

The platform's build system will securely make this variable available to the application.
